# Querit - Connecting People and Ideas
## What's this?
Querit is a project created by three students studying Computer Applications at CHRIST (Deemed-to-be University), Yeshwanthpur Campus, Bengaluru. It's like a virtual meeting place where people can come together to share knowledge, find collaborators, or even land internships.

Imagine you're looking for someone nearby who knows a lot about a specific topic, like creating web servers. Querit helps you find exactly that, whether they're a student, a professional, or an employer. You can also find like-minded people to work with on your projects or find talented individuals to collaborate with.

We're not the first ones to do this, but we're making it easier by bringing everything together in one place. In simple terms, Querit is like a specialized platform designed to help people learn from each other and connect with others who share their interests. It's all about sharing ideas, having discussions, and learning together.

With features like personalized profiles, threaded discussions, and careful content moderation, Querit creates an environment where learning and collaboration thrive. We use established systems to make sure everything runs smoothly, so users can focus on exploring new ideas and growing together.

## Why Querit?
In the midst of our academic pursuits, tasked with the creation of a comprehensive project spanning front-end, back-end, and database integration, we encountered a common dilemma among students: the reluctance to vocalize inquiries in class, often stemming from apprehension or self-consciousness. Thus, Querit was conceivedâ€”a sanctuary where queries are welcomed without reservation.

## Who Uses Querit?
As we develop and test this project, the primary users will be our teachers and a select group of students who will help populate the site with content and make it active. Teachers and coordinators will have admin privileges to moderate the content. Initially, users will be able to make text-based posts only. Once we ensure the basic functionality of the site is stable, we'll gradually introduce the ability to share multimedia content.

## The App
This is a web app hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) for now. We are using MongoDb to manage our database hosted through AWS in a NoSQL database. While the backend will be made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the frontend is made up of HTML, CSS and JS. 

More information will be added as we develop the application in the times to come. Please note that this committed files don't reflect the current status of the project.
