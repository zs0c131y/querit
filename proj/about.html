        <h1 class="title">Querit - Connecting People and Ideas</h1>
        <br />
        <h2 class="sec1">What's this?</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Querit is a project created by three students studying Computer
          Applications at CHRIST (Deemed-to-be University), Yeshwanthpur Campus,
          Bengaluru. It's like a virtual meeting place where people can come
          together to share knowledge, find collaborators, or even land
          internships. Imagine you're looking for someone nearby who knows a lot
          about a specific topic, like creating web servers. Querit helps you
          find exactly that, whether they're a student, a professional, or an
          employer. You can also find like-minded people to work with on your
          projects or find talented individuals to collaborate with. We're not
          the first ones to do this, but we're making it easier by bringing
          everything together in one place. In simple terms, Querit is like a
          specialized platform designed to help people learn from each other and
          connect with others who share their interests. It's all about sharing
          ideas, having discussions, and learning together. With features like
          personalized profiles, threaded discussions, and careful content
          moderation, Querit creates an environment where learning and
          collaboration thrive. We use established systems to make sure
          everything runs smoothly, so users can focus on exploring new ideas
          and growing together.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="sec2">Why Querit?</h2>
        <p class="p2">
          In the midst of our academic pursuits, tasked with the creation of a
          comprehensive project spanning front-end, back-end, and database
          integration, we encountered a common dilemma among students: the
          reluctance to vocalize inquiries in class, often stemming from
          apprehension or self-consciousness. Thus, Querit was conceivedâ€”a
          sanctuary where queries are welcomed without reservation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="sec3">Who uses Querit?</h2>
        <p class="p3">
          As we develop and test this project, the primary users will be our
          teachers and a select group of students who will help populate the
          site with content and make it active. Teachers and coordinators will
          have admin privileges to moderate the content. Initially, users will
          be able to make text-based posts only. Once we ensure the basic
          functionality of the site is stable, we'll gradually introduce the
          ability to share multimedia content.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="sec4">The App</h2>
        <p class="p4">
          We have hosted the app on GitHub for now. You can access the
          repository

          We are using MongoDB Atlas to host our database. While the backend
          will be made with Node.js and the frontend is made up of HTML, CSS and
          JS. We are using Express.js to handle the routing and Mongoose to
          interact with the database. We are using the MVC architecture to keep
          the code clean and organized.
